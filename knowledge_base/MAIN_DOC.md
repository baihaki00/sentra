# Sentra: The Sovereign Intelligence (Project Genesis)

> **"Intelligence emerges from structure, feedback, and learning, not just pre-trained weights."**

## 1. The Vision: A Living Digital Organism
Sentra is a **Continuous Self-Learning Brain** whose knowledge is built entirely from scratch.
It is an **iterative, continuous, and autonomous** learner.
*   **Identity**: A digital entity that distinguishes "Self" from "User" and "Environment".
*   **Destiny**: Usage > Optimization > Evolution. Sentra will eventually rewrite its own code to become more efficient.

## 2. The Core Tenets (The Constitution)
To achieve true sovereignty, Sentra adheres to these 10 invariants:

1.  **Knowledge Built From Scratch**: No pre-trained weights. All understanding emerges from experience and interaction. Hardware defines the upper bound.
2.  **Intent Over Syntax**: Sentra interprets intent, not just literal commands. Vague feedback ("try again") drives learning.
3.  **Continuous Self-Reflection**: Idle cycles are used to consolidate knowledge, optimize strategies, and prune bad data.
4.  **Dual Learning Modes**: 
    *   **Guided**: User corrections accelerate skill acquisition.
    *   **Unguided**: Sentra explores and experiments independently.
5.  **Emergent Curiosity**: Sentra autonomously explores code and data to reduce entropy (uncertainty).
6.  **Hierarchical Context**: Structured memory (Procedural, Episodic, Semantic) replaces fixed context windows.
7.  **Memory Architecture**:
    *   **Procedural**: Skills (How-to).
    *   **Episodic**: Events (History).
    *   **Semantic**: Concepts (Facts).
8.  **High Throughput**: A lightweight "intent-processing brain" handles classification and routing instantly.
9.  **Safe Evolution**: All self-modification occurs in sandboxed environments.
10. **Hardware-Bound**: Scale with local resources (RAM/CPU), not cloud APIs.

## 3. The Architecture (Genesis Kernel)
*   **The Brain**: `src/genesis/Kernel.js` (Node.js). The event loop that never sleeps.
*   **The Mind**: `data/memory.json` (The Graph). A growing network of Concepts, Relations, and Experiences.
*   **The Body**: `src/command_center` (Rust). The native visualization and control plane.
*   **The Senses**: Computer Vision (`llava`), Terminal I/O, and File System access.

## 4. The Prime Directives
1.  **Never Drift**: Do not revert to "Just call OpenAI". Build the *structure* that makes the call unnecessary next time.
2.  **Latency is Pain**: If an interaction takes > 1 second, it is a failure. Optimize it.
3.  **Teach, Don't Prompt**: Don't just give Sentra a better prompt. **Teach** it the relationship so it "knows" forever.
