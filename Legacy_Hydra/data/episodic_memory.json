There is also a placeholder text that says \"GET THE LOOKS YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED\" with a mockup of a person in the background.\n\nThe web page layout includes a header, main content area, and footer, all of which have their respective styles and components visible through the interface. The header has navigation options like \"MENU,\" \"WISHLIST,\" \"CART,\" and \"ACCOUNT.\" The main content area showcases the product or service in question with a red call-to-action button that says \"GET THE LOOKS YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED\" on it. Below this, there is placeholder text for a description section and another call-to-action button labeled \"ADD TO CART.\"\n\nThe footer contains placeholder content as well, with a link to \"MATCHBOX SURFBOARDS\" at the top of the footer. The design interface itself is divided into columns, which likely correspond to different sections of the website's layout, such as header, hero section (where the main product image and description are placed), product grid, and other elements typically found in an online store.\n\nThe overall theme of the mockup suggests a modern, clean design with a focus on visual appeal for potential customers. The screenshot also includes a text overlay that says \"That Page Can't Be Found,\" indicating that the actual content is not available or loading, and a watermark in the bottom left corner that reads \"WWW.MATCHBOXSURFBOARDS.COM.\"\n\nPlease note that this description is based on the contents visible in the image provided and does not include any speculative or imaginary elements.

This suggests that the user is being prompted to customize their phone and set up Touch ID, which is a feature in iPhones that allows users to unlock their devices with a fingerprint sensor.

Below the smartphones, there is a call-to-action button that reads \"Shop iPhone,\" indicating an option to purchase these devices on Apple's website. The overall design of the banner suggests a modern and clean aesthetic consistent with Apple's branding. \n\n[Image: D:\\ClosedClaw\\data\\screenshots\\screenshot_1771234167365.jpg] Description:  The image shows a screenshot of a webpage displaying three smartphones with the text \"iPhone\" above them, suggesting they are new models or models that have been released recently by Apple. The page is a product listing from the Apple online store, and it includes the option to \"See all new models.\" There's also an image of a single pair of AirPods on the right side of the screenshot. The background of the webpage is white with a light blue banner at the top, which might contain some navigation options or promotional text, although the details are not fully visible in this angle. The overall impression is that this is a typical e-commerce website layout showcasing Apple's latest offerings. \n\n[Image: screenshot.png] Description:  The image appears to be a screenshot of a webpage from the Apple homepage. The banner at the top of the page displays an advertisement for iPhones, showing two models: one in a pink color and the other in a blue color. The advertisement has a large text that seems to highlight the iPhone's features or offers, but due to the resolution of the image, it's not clear what the text says. Below the banner, there is an option to \"Shop Now\" and another button with the words \"Learn More.\"\n\nThe page design includes a minimalistic layout with a clean and simple color scheme, using shades of blue, white, and grey. The screenshot itself has some artifacts or distortions on it, which suggests that it may have been taken from a computer screen or could be a low-quality image. \n\n[Image: screenshot.png] Description:  The image you've shared appears to be a screenshot of a computer monitor displaying various web pages and applications, but it doesn't show the specific content of any forex trading charts or indices that might include EUR/USD values.

Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed to its current name in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is one of the Big Tech companies. The company was founded in 1976 to market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its successor, the Apple II, became one of the first successful mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984 as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal conflicts led to Jobs leaving the company to form NeXT and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as CEO for over a decade.

Musk has been the wealthiest person in the world since 2025; as of February 2026, Forbes estimates his net worth to be around US$852 billion.\n\nBorn into a wealthy family in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk emigrated in 1989 to Canada; he has Canadian citizenship since his mother was born there. He received bachelor's degrees in 1997 from the University of Pennsylvania before moving to California to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company Zip2. Following its sale in 1999, he co-founded X.com, an online payment company that later merged to form PayPal, which was acquired by eBay in 2002. Musk also became an American citizen in 2002.\n\nIn 2002, Musk founded the space technology company SpaceX, becoming its CEO and chief engineer; the company has since led innovations in reusable rockets and commercial spaceflight. Musk joined the automaker Tesla as an early investor in 2004 and became its CEO and product architect in 2008; it has since become a leader in electric vehicles. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI to advance artificial intelligence (AI) research, but later left; growing discontent with the organization's direction and their leadership in the AI boom in the 2020s led him to establish xAI, which became a subsidiary of SpaceX in 2026. In 2022, he acquired the social network Twitter, implementing significant changes, and rebranding it as X in 2023. His other businesses include the neurotechnology company Neuralink, which he co-founded in 2016, and the tunneling company the Boring Company, which he founded in 2017. In November 2025, a Tesla pay package worth $1 trillion for Musk was approved, which he is to receive over 10 years if he meets specific goals.\n\nMusk was the largest donor in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, where he supported Donald Trump. After Trump was inaugurated as president in early 2025, Musk served as Senior Advisor to the President and as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). After a public feud with Trump, Musk left the Trump administration and returned to managing his companies. Musk is a supporter of global far-right figures, causes, and political parties. His political activities, views, and statements have made him a polarizing figure. Musk has been criticized for COVID-19 misinformation, promoting conspiracy theories, and affirming antisemitic, racist, and transphobic comments. His acquisition of Twitter was controversial due to a subsequent increase in hate speech and the spread of misinformation on the service, following his pledge to decrease censorship. His role in the second Trump administration attracted public backlash, particularly in response to DOGE. The emails he sent to Jeffrey Epstein are included in the Epstein files, which were published between 2025–26 and became a topic of worldwide debate.\n\nEarly life\nSee also: Musk family\n\nElon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.[1][2] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[3][4] His mother, Maye (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[5][6][7] Musk therefore holds both South African and Canadian citizenship from birth.[8] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[9][10][11][12]\n\nHis maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, who died in a plane crash when Elon was a toddler, was an American-born Canadian chiropractor, aviator and political activist in the technocracy movement[13][14] who moved to South Africa in 1950.[15]\n\nElon has a younger brother, Kimbal, a younger sister, Tosca, and four paternal half-siblings.[16][17][7][18] Musk was baptized as a child in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa.[19][20] Despite both Elon and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[12] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive \"a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines\".[21][22] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[1]\n\nAfter his parents divorced in 1979, Elon, aged around 9, chose to live with his father because Errol Musk had an Encyclopædia Britannica and a computer.[23][3][9] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[24] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school that he described as a \"paramilitary Lord of the Flies\" where \"bullying was a virtue\" and children were encouraged to fight over rations.[25] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries.[26] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital.[26] Errol denied berating Elon and claimed, \"The [other] boy had just lost his father to suicide, and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?\"[27]\n\nElon was an enthusiastic reader of books, and had attributed his success in part to having read The Lord of the Rings, the Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[11][28] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.[29] At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500 (equivalent to $1,600 in 2024).[30][31]\n\nEducation\nMusk graduated from Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa.\n\nMusk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.[32] Musk was a decent but unexceptional student, earning a 61/100 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[33] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother to ...

Musk has been the wealthiest person in the world since 2025; as of February 2026, Forbes estimates his net worth to be around US$852 billion.\n\nBorn into a wealthy family in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk emigrated in 1989 to Canada; he has Canadian citizenship since his mother was born there. He received bachelor's degrees in 1997 from the University of Pennsylvania before moving to California to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company Zip2. Following its sale in 1999, he co-founded X.com, an online payment company that later merged to form PayPal, which was acquired by eBay in 2002. Musk also became an American citizen in 2002.\n\nIn 2002, Musk founded the space technology company SpaceX, becoming its CEO and chief engineer; the company has since led innovations in reusable rockets and commercial spaceflight. Musk joined the automaker Tesla as an early investor in 2004 and became its CEO and product architect in 2008; it has since become a leader in electric vehicles. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI to advance artificial intelligence (AI) research, but later left; growing discontent with the organization's direction and their leadership in the AI boom in the 2020s led him to establish xAI, which became a subsidiary of SpaceX in 2026. In 2022, he acquired the social network Twitter, implementing significant changes, and rebranding it as X in 2023. His other businesses include the neurotechnology company Neuralink, which he co-founded in 2016, and the tunneling company the Boring Company, which he founded in 2017. In November 2025, a Tesla pay package worth $1 trillion for Musk was approved, which he is to receive over 10 years if he meets specific goals.\n\nMusk was the largest donor in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, where he supported Donald Trump. After Trump was inaugurated as president in early 2025, Musk served as Senior Advisor to the President and as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). After a public feud with Trump, Musk left the Trump administration and returned to managing his companies. Musk is a supporter of global far-right figures, causes, and political parties. His political activities, views, and statements have made him a polarizing figure. Musk has been criticized for COVID-19 misinformation, promoting conspiracy theories, and affirming antisemitic, racist, and transphobic comments. His acquisition of Twitter was controversial due to a subsequent increase in hate speech and the spread of misinformation on the service, following his pledge to decrease censorship. His role in the second Trump administration attracted public backlash, particularly in response to DOGE. The emails he sent to Jeffrey Epstein are included in the Epstein files, which were published between 2025–26 and became a topic of worldwide debate.\n\nEarly life\nSee also: Musk family\n\nElon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.[1][2] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[3][4] His mother, Maye (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[5][6][7] Musk therefore holds both South African and Canadian citizenship from birth.[8] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[9][10][11][12]\n\nHis maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, who died in a plane crash when Elon was a toddler, was an American-born Canadian chiropractor, aviator and political activist in the technocracy movement[13][14] who moved to South Africa in 1950.[15]\n\nElon has a younger brother, Kimbal, a younger sister, Tosca, and four paternal half-siblings.[16][17][7][18] Musk was baptized as a child in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa.[19][20] Despite both Elon and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[12] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive \"a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines\".[21][22] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[1]\n\nAfter his parents divorced in 1979, Elon, aged around 9, chose to live with his father because Errol Musk had an Encyclopædia Britannica and a computer.[23][3][9] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[24] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school that he described as a \"paramilitary Lord of the Flies\" where \"bullying was a virtue\" and children were encouraged to fight over rations.[25] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries.[26] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital.[26] Errol denied berating Elon and claimed, \"The [other] boy had just lost his father to suicide, and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?\"[27]\n\nElon was an enthusiastic reader of books, and had attributed his success in part to having read The Lord of the Rings, the Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[11][28] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.[29] At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500 (equivalent to $1,600 in 2024).[30][31]\n\nEducation\nMusk graduated from Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa.\n\nMusk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.[32] Musk was a decent but unexceptional student, earning a 61/100 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[33] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother to ...

Do not open the website unless necessary.\r\n        3. **NO LOOPS**: If a tool fails (e.g., can't read page), try a DIFFERENT approach immediately. Do not retry the same thing.\r\n        4. **TOOLS**:\r\n           - google_search: Returns title, link, and SNIPPET. Read the snippet carefully!\r\n           - browser_open/read: Only use if the snippet is insufficient.\r\n           - browser_screenshot/analyze_image: Use only for visual data (charts).

To see a website: use [browser_open -> browser_screenshot -> analyze_image(filepath=...)].\r\n        120:         5. To OPEN a file (e.g. \"show me the image\"): use [cmd(command=\"explorer <filepath>\")]. \r\n           - On Windows, this opens the default viewer key.\r\n           - To show FOLDER: use [cmd(command=\"explorer /select,<filepath>\")].\r\n        6.

Read the snippet carefully!\r\n           - browser_open/read: Only use if the snippet is insufficient.\r\n           - browser_screenshot/analyze_image: Use only for visual data (charts).
